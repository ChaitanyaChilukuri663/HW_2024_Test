# Endless Runner Game: Doofus Adventure

## Overview

Pulpit Adventure is an endless runner game developed in Unity. The player controls a cube character (Doofus) that moves from one pulpit (platform) to another, avoiding falling off. The game features random spawning of platforms with a countdown timer on each, creating a challenging gameplay experience where quick reflexes and precise movements are essential.

## Game Features

- **Endless Runner Gameplay:** The game continues indefinitely, with the difficulty gradually increasing as more pulpits appear.
- **Dynamic Pulpit Generation:** Pulpits spawn randomly adjacent to the current one, creating a unique path for each playthrough.
- **Countdown Timer:** Each pulpit displays a timer that indicates when it will be destroyed, adding to the challenge.
- **Score Tracking:** Players earn points for each successful move from one pulpit to another, and the score is displayed on the screen.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the player falls off a pulpit or if no valid pulpits are available to jump to.

1. **Start the Game:** Launch the game from Unity Editor or build and run it on your preferred platform.
2. **Control the Character:** Use the arrow keys to move Doofus to adjacent pulpits.
3. **Stay on the Pulpits:** Move to a new pulpit before the current oneâ€™s timer reaches zero.
